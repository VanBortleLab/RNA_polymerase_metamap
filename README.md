# Overview:

We applied a uniform, context-agnostic framework for scoring RNA polymerase (Pol) I, II, and III occupancies using > 200 ChIP-seq experiments performed in human tissues and cell lines, facilitating unbiased annotation of polymerase occupancy and overlap. This repository includes processed files and details related to our manuscript: KC et al., ...

# Data processing:

We retrieved available ChIP-seq data corresponding to complex-specific Pol I, II, and III subunits. Previous mapp- ing experiments for human Pol I are exceptionally limited, with only 2 datasets for binding of the large subunits, POLR1A and POLR1B 17,18. Pol II datasets are significantly more abundant, with 153 POLR2A ChIP-seq experiments available for the large subunit of Pol II. ChIP-seq experi- ments for Pol III, on the other hand, include a multitude of Pol III-specific subunits, including POLR3A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -G
